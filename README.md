p5js를 이용해 사용자와 인터랙트 가능한 메뉴판을 제작하였습니다.

In korea we often come across menu boards in cafes or restaurants that are written in English. Owners 
choose to write menus in English to create an atmosphere that complements the interior of the 
establishment. Nevertheless, I believe that in Korea, we should create menus that are easily understood 
by all Korean consumers, including not only English-proficient young generations but also children and the elderly.

To improve this situation, I believe it is essential to change people's fundamental perception.
I wanted to instill the notion that menus primarily centered around the Korean language, our own language, are natural and impressive. 
Rather than simply admiring foreign cultures, I hope for a fusion of incoming foreign cultures with our own 
emotions and language, creating a more remarkable culture
